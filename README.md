A Python program to be used on shared unix servers to cheer people up

An old project for [tilde.town](https://tilde.town)

## Note: 
This has been modified to work on [tilde.town](https://tilde.town), but you may adjust it accordingly

## How it works
Stores the user's input into a generated `list.txt` file if an argument is given in quotes. If no arguments are given, a random line from the `list.txt` file will be displayed.

## Usage
### Adding a message to the file:
`$ nicethings "insert your message here"`
### Randomly generate a message:
`$ nicethings`
