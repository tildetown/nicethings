# How it works

Each user on the shared Unix server may have a `.nicethings` file. The
`.nicethings` file may be populated with a list of nice messages
created by a user. All users' `.nicethings` files are converted to
lists. All lists are combined into one list. A random nice message is
picked from from this list and is displayed to the user.

## How it works in detail

* Each user has a `~/.nicethings` directory.
* Users can add messages to this file using the `nicethings add "your nice message here"` interface.
* Each message is stored in the file as separate lines. No file format is used.
* Users can display a numbered list of the messages they have stored using the `nicethings ls` interface.
* Users can remove their own messages using the `nicethings rm 2` interface, where the number refers to an item in their list.
* Users can view a random message from a random user using the `nicethings` interface (with no arguments).
