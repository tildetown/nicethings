# nicethings
A poorly written python script that will hopefully cheer some people up

Note: I've modified the file paths in this script so it will work on [tilde.town](https://tilde.town). You can adjust it accordingly

### How it works
It stores user{'s/s'} input into a text file if an argument is given. If no arguments are given, a random nice message from the text file will be displayed.

### Usage
##### Adding a message to the file:
`nicethings "insert your message here"`
##### Randomly generate a message:
`nicethings`
