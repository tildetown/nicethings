# nicethings
A Python program to be used on shared unix servers to cheer people up (A little program for [tilde.town](https://tilde.town))

# How it works
Stores the user's input into a generated `list.txt` file if an argument is given in quotes. If no arguments are given, a random line from the `list.txt` file will be displayed.

# Usage
## Adding a message to the file:
`$ nicethings "insert your message here"`

## Outputting a random line from list.txt:
`$ nicethings`

# To-dos
[ ] Only allow quoted messages to be added 
[ ] Decentralize by allowing users to store their own
repository in their home folder
