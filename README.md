# How it works

Stores the user's input into a generated `list.txt` file if an argument is given in quotes. If no arguments are given, a random line from the `list.txt` file will be displayed.

# Usage

Currently, a user can only add and output nice things to and from a list.txt located in m455's directory

## Adding a message to the file:

`$ nicethings "insert your message here"`

## Outputting a random line from list.txt:

`$ nicethings`
